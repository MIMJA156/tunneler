# tunneler
per someone's request lol

## About
This plugin adds a new enchantment called the tunneler. You can enchant any pickaxe by using the crafting recipe below!
The concept is simple, whenever you break a block, it will break a 3x3 zone around the initial block you broke.
Depending on how far you are looking down it will either destroy along the wall or along the floor.
